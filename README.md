# Tech stacks used:
- **FastAPI**: A high-performance Python-based framework for creating backend servers. 📈
- **Mongo db database**: A NoSQL database. I preferred this over the SQL database due to its performance and the highly unstructured data required. 📊
- **open, long-chain, Deepgram SDKs, and other libraries**: They deal with LLMs, Voice, and other AI-based works. 🤖
- **Redis**: Open source key-value pair in-memory database. It is used to avoid DDOS attacks through a rate-limiting strategy. 📝
- **Websockts**: Websocket is used over the rest of the API for agents to have better connection management. 🤝🏻
- **Qdrant**: An open-source vector database for semantic search. Used for user search on the search bar. 🎉
- **Docker**: A DevOps tool to containerize applications. 🐋
- **Git**: Version control system. 🐱
- **Linux**: All development is done on Linux machines. 🐧
